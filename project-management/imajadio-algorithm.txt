Imajadio Algorithm


for a picture:

	for each column:
		//generate create audio by adding all frequencies

		for each pixel:
		//map it to a frequency with an amplitude

			for each sample:
				

OPTIMIZATIONS TO MAKE:
- Frequency calculation is the same for every column. Only determine frequency set once.
--> when calculating each set, just determine increment, and add increment to get all frequencies instead of doing whole calculation for each successive pixel.




Mapping a pixel to a frequency:
f(x) = (h-x) * F/(h+1), where:
	   f = frequency of a pixel (Hz)
	   x = pixel's vertical offset (from top --> down)
	   h = height of image (in pixels)
	   F = total number of frequencies
	  
Mapping a pixel to an amplitude:
a(x) = [r(x)+g(x)+b(x)]/765 * M/h, where:
	   a = amplitude of a pixel
	   x = pixel's vertical offset (from top --> down)
	   h = height of image (in pixels)
	   M = maximum amplitude or resolution of audio
