Imajadio Algorithm


Inputted:
- a picture (height and width)


for a picture:

	for each column:
		//generate create audio by adding all frequencies

		for each pixel:
		//map it to a frequency with an amplitude

			for each sample:



Classes:
- Pixel class
--> vertical offset
--> horizontal offset
--> R
--> G
--> B
--> frequency
--> amplitude
				

				
				

Mapping a pixel to a frequency:
f(x) = x * (h+1)/F, where:
	   f = frequency of a pixel (Hz)
	   x = pixel's vertical offset
	   h = height of image (in pixels)
	   F = total number of frequencies
	  
Mapping a pixel to an amplitude:
a(x) = [r(x)+g(x)+b(x)]/765 * M/h, where:
	   a = amplitude of a pixel
	   x = pixel's vertical offset
	   h = height of image (in pixels)
	   M = maximum amplitude or resolution of audio
